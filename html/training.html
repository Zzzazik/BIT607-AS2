       <h2>About the organization</h2>
       <p>Our society was formed by a group of Matahi residents in 1951 for the purpose of promoting
        the history of Matahi and its people.
        What do we do?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We research and study the people and places associated with Matahi.</li>
            <li>We preserve archival items of historical importance.</li>
            <li>We draw attention to important historical features in and around Matahi.</li>
            <li>We support individual members’ historical projects.</li>
            <li>We maintain links with regional and national historical societies.</li>
            <li>We meet four times a year and invite guest speakers.</li>
            <li>We arrange outings to places of historical interest.</li>
            <li>We publish a newsletter four times a year.</li>
            <li>We host photo collections online.</li>
        </ul>
       <p>As a voluntary organisation with limited resources, we’re unable to undertake research on
        request. However, you’re welcome to use our archives.
        We reserve the right to refuse photos that are offensive, and in these cases we’ll explain our
        reasons. Examples of these reasons include being inappropriate, being offensive to others,
        being culturally insensitive, or violating Māori tikanga.
        Membership is $50 per year for general members; there is a 10% discount for retirees.
        We currently have 100 members and we welcome new members, no matter where they live.</p>
