            <h1>Let me tell you about Us</h1>
            <p>Our journey started with a simple goal: to
                provide a dining experience that honors
                Māori food and culture while welcoming 
                everyone. Our menu features a mix of Māori
                and Pākeha dishes, designed to please every
                palate. We begin meals with traditional
                Māori blessings (karakia) and aim to 
                create a warm and inviting atmosphere
                for every visit to Haukai.more
                than just 
                a meal—it's an experience.

            <p>Although we currently operate with a small, close-knit team,
                we’re excited about the future. As our reputation grows, we
                look forward to expanding our team with 
                additional part-time staff who share our passion 
                for exceptional service and authentic cuisine.</p>
